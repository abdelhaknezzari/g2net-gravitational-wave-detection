```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

Read file npy

```{r cars}
library(RcppCNPy)
library(fs)
library(tidyr)

'/Users/abdelhaknezzari/Downloads/5000814d6b.npy' %>% 
  RcppCNPy::npyLoad() %>% 
  as.matrix() %>% 
  log() %>% 
  plot()

fs::file_info('/Users/abdelhaknezzari/Downloads/5000814d6b.npy')
fs::


getwd()


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
